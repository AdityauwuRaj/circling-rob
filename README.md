# circling-rob
For the control of crn_bot, I employed CoppeliaSim API in linking it to IDLE.
An additional function for rotation was created by me for the bot.
The robot moves along circles of 3 different radii, when left_wheel and right_wheel velocities are applied together with some delay.
I used sim.setJointTargetVelocity() to achieve this.
